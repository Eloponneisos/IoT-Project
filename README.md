## Intro
In this project I will make an autonomous line-tracking car. The car is a prototype for the Mercedes Benz museum. Once done, the car will be able to perform the following actions:
1. Follow a white line
2. Detect obstacles in it's way using a HC-SR04 sensor
3. Detect if it has collided with anything
4. Show the battery voltage through a RGB-led indicator
5. Show the status of the vehicle through 4 different leds
6. It'll have a startup-tune
7. Web interface (grafana)
8. It'll also be able to stop at a traversal line at which point it either starts driving after 5sec or after the pressing of a button.
